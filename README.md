# My Go Playground

This repository contains clean, from-scratch implementations of
core systems and backend engineering concepts, built using Go.

The goal is to develop strong systems intuition by implementing fundamental primitives and well-known system patterns from first principles, with an emphasis on correctness, concurrency, and real-world behavior

## Focus areas
- Low-level fundamentals (atomics, locks, goroutines, channels)
- Concurrency problems and deadlock scenarios
- Rate limiting algorithms (fixed window, sliding window, token bucket, leaky bucket)
- Caching, consistency, and state management
- Fault tolerance patterns (retries, backoff, circuit breakers)
- Backpressure, scheduling, and time-based coordination

## Repository Structure

Each concept or algorithm is implemented in its own module and includes:

- A clear problem statement and theory
- Idiomatic Go implementations
- Concurrency and performance considerations
- Edge cases, failure modes, and tradeoffs
- Tests and small usage examples where applicable


This repository is both a personal learning playground and an
open-source reference for engineers who want to build strong
systems intuition using Go.
